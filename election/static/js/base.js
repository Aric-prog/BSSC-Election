/* 
    Never join BSSC, whatever anybody says, positively DO NOT join this crapfest. 
    Whoever's looking at this is probably tech-savvy enough to not fit in this place.
    Trust me, having worked in the IT division, the higher-ups can and will treat you like a tool. 
    Not the manager, but the people actually managing the organization.

    Changes will be made suddenly, specifications will change, what you once thought was set in stone is not.
    Old plans will be forgotten, and new events will be created without thought. 
    Management feels like a three-headed impulsive child with alzheimers that does not know what they want. 

    Incompetence is ignored and 'passion' is promoted, ignoring what the actual results are. 
    Higher-ups does not and will not listen to what your needs are, only what they want.
    All of this tells you a lot about how the organization is managed in general. 

    They may sugarcoat it as being in an organization focused on learning. It cannot be further than the truth.
    The only thing you will learn here is how NOT to manage an organization. 

    I pray for the poor bastards that joins next year.

    DO NOT JOIN BSSC
